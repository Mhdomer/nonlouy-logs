# About Me

**Hey, I'm Muhamed Omar!**

I’m a 3rd-year student at **Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)** studying Networking and Security. I’m passionate about cloud infrastructure and network security, .

Right now, I’m focused on improving my skills in offensive security, Linux, and network fundamentals, and I document my learning journey through projects, notes, and write-ups. I’m also working on my final year project and using this space to track my progress, experiments, and ideas.

This blog is basically my technical journal: what I learn, what I try, what works, what doesn’t, and how I improve over time. You’ll find:

- **CTF & Lab Writeups** from HackTheBox, TryHackMe, and Root-Me
- **Security Challenges** and technical problem-solving
- **Learning Materials** on networking, cloud security, and pentesting
- **Labs & Experiments** in hands-on cybersecurity

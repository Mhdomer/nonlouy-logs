**Hi, I'm Muhamed Omar.**

I am a student and networking practitioner with a strong interest in security and cloud. This blog is my public lab notebook where I document what I’m learning, the labs I solve, and projects I build.

You’ll find detailed walkthroughs, technical write-ups, and notes from platforms like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, Root-Me, and more — all focused on understanding systems and securing them.

**Let’s connect, learn, and build together.**
